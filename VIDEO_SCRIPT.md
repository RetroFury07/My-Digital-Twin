## 🎯 Script Outline

### INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Scene: You at your desk with good lighting, looking at camera]**

> "Hi! I'm Xevi Olivas, but you can call me Tony. I'm an AI developer and computer vision researcher specializing in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Today, I'm excited to show you my Digital Twin portfolio—an AI-powered platform that not only showcases my work but actually *understands* it."

**[Smile and gesture to your screen]**

> "Let me show you what makes this different from a typical portfolio."

---

### PART 1: Portfolio Overview (0:30 - 1:30)

**[Screen recording: Navigate to portfolio home page at localhost:3001]**

> "This is my interactive portfolio built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's fully responsive and features a clean, modern design with dark mode support."

**[Demonstrate dark mode toggle]**

> "But what makes this special is the AI assistant you see here in the bottom right."

**[Click on the chat bubble icon]**

> "This isn't just a contact form—this is my Digital Twin. It's an AI system that knows everything about my professional background, skills, projects, and experience."

**[Show the chat interface opening]**

---

### PART 2: Digital Twin Demo (1:30 - 3:00)

**[Type in the chat: "What are Xevi's main technical skills?"]**

> "Let me ask it about my technical skills."

**[Wait for response, then read key highlights]**

> "As you can see, it provides detailed, accurate information pulled from my professional profile using Retrieval-Augmented Generation—or RAG for short."

**[Type another question: "Tell me about the Powered Proctoring project"]**

> "Now let's ask about one of my major projects—the Powered Proctoring System."

**[Let it respond, highlight key metrics]**

> "Notice how it provides specific metrics—92% detection accuracy, 500+ students monitored, 30 FPS real-time performance. This is because the AI is retrieving exact data from my vector database, not hallucinating information."

**[Type: "What technologies does Xevi use for computer vision?"]**

> "I can even ask technical questions about my expertise areas."

**[Show response highlighting YOLOv8, MediaPipe, OpenCV, TensorFlow]**

---

### PART 3: Technical Architecture (3:00 - 4:00)

**[Switch to showing yourself or keep screen recording with voiceover]**

> "Here's what's happening under the hood: When you ask a question, the system converts it into a semantic embedding using OpenAI's text-embedding model. It then searches through my professional profile stored in Upstash Vector database—a serverless vector database that enables lightning-fast similarity search."

**[Optional: Show architecture diagram or code briefly]**

> "The most relevant information is retrieved and sent to Groq's Llama 3.1 model, which generates a natural, contextual response. The entire process takes less than 2 seconds."

**[Back to portfolio]**

> "This technology stack includes:
> - Next.js 13 with TypeScript for the frontend
> - FastAPI for the backend API
> - Upstash Vector for semantic search
> - Groq API with Llama 3.1 for AI responses
> - And everything is deployed on Vercel with 99.5% uptime"

---

### PART 4: Portfolio Features (4:00 - 4:45)

**[Navigate through different sections]**

> "Beyond the AI assistant, the portfolio includes all the essentials:"

**[Scroll through sections]**

> "A comprehensive About section, my Experience timeline showcasing my work on AI-powered systems, a Projects gallery featuring real deployments like the Powered Proctoring System that served 500+ students, my technical Skills spanning Python, computer vision, machine learning, and web development, my Education background, and a Contact section."

**[Navigate smoothly through each section]**

> "Each section is crafted with attention to detail, using animations and responsive design principles."

---

### PART 5: Why This Matters (4:45 - 5:15)

**[Back to you on camera]**

> "So why build an AI-powered portfolio? Because I don't just want to *tell* you I'm an AI developer—I want to *show* you. This project demonstrates my ability to:

> - Build end-to-end AI systems from concept to production
> - Integrate modern technologies like RAG and vector databases
> - Create user-friendly interfaces that make complex AI accessible
> - Deploy scalable applications with real-world performance"

**[Confident, friendly tone]**

> "Every line of code, every design decision, every optimization—it all reflects my approach to building intelligent systems that create value."

---

### CLOSING (5:15 - 5:30)

**[Smile at camera]**

> "If you'd like to experience my Digital Twin yourself, or learn more about my work in computer vision and AI development, you can find all my contact information in the description below. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills in AI, machine learning, and intelligent systems to solve meaningful problems."

**[Warm closing]**

> "Thanks for watching, and I look forward to connecting with you!"

3. ✅ **Clean your desktop**: Close unnecessary applications
4. ✅ **Set up lighting**: Good lighting on your face if showing yourself
5. ✅ **Check audio**: Use a decent microphone, minimize background noise
6. ✅ **Browser setup**: Use Chrome/Edge in clean profile, zoom to 100%
7. ✅ **Disable notifications**: Turn off OS and browser notifications

### During Recording:
- 🎥 **Record in 1080p minimum** (1920x1080)
- 🎙️ **Speak clearly and at moderate pace** - you can always speed up in editing
- 💡 **Smile and show enthusiasm** - energy is contagious
- ⏸️ **Pause between sections** - easier to edit transitions
- 🖱️ **Move mouse deliberately** - slow, purposeful movements on screen
- 👁️ **Look at camera when addressing viewer**, screen when demonstrating

### Screen Recording Settings:
```
Resolution: 1920x1080
Frame Rate: 30fps
Format: MP4
Audio: Include system audio + microphone
Cursor: Show cursor during demos
```

### Recommended Tools:
