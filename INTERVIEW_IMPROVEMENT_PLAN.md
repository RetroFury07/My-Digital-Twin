## 🚨 Critical Issues Breakdown

### Issue #1: C++ Skills Gap (BLOCKER for C++ roles)
**Problem:**  
- Listed "1 year basic C++" but NO production projects  
- No GitHub repos with C++ code  
- No specific C++ achievements documented  
- Job required Python AND C++ - only strong in Python  

**Impact on Interview:**  
- Technical score: 2/5 for C++  
- Credibility concern: "Can they actually code in C++?"  
- Interviewer perception: "Embellishing resume"  

**Root Cause:**  
- Academic C++ only (data structures, algorithms)  
- No real-world C++ projects to showcase  
- Overstated proficiency level  

---

### Issue #2: Career Path Misalignment (RETENTION RISK)
**Problem:**  
- Senior AI engineer profile for entry-level programmer role  
- Job = generic programming; Candidate = AI/ML specialist  
- No AI component in job posting  

**Impact on Interview:**  
- Overall fit: 5/10  
- Retention risk: HIGH (likely to leave within 6-12 months)  
- Interviewer concern: "Why does an AI researcher want this basic role?"  

**Root Cause:**  
- Applying to any "programming" job without fit analysis  
- Not targeting AI-specific roles  
- Desperation vs. strategic job search  

---

### Issue #3: Overqualification Concern (FLIGHT RISK)
**Problem:**  
- Led AI research teams → applying for entry-level programmer  
- Published research → basic coding role  
- 92% accuracy system → maintenance work  

**Impact on Interview:**  
- Cultural fit: 5/10  
- Interviewer fear: "They'll get bored and leave"  
- Salary mismatch: ₱800K-1M for entry-level unrealistic

## 🎓 Key Learnings from Interview Simulation

### What Went Right ✅
1. **Strong Python/AI foundation** - clearly communicated expertise  
2. **Quantifiable achievements** - 92% accuracy, 500+ users, 3x speedup  
3. **Leadership evidence** - led team, mentored, published research  
4. **Technical depth** - could discuss YOLOv8, MediaPipe, RAG systems  

### What Went Wrong ❌
1. **Wrong role targeting** - applied to mismatched position  
2. **C++ gap exposed** - claimed skills without evidence  
3. **Salary unrealistic** - ₱800K-1M for entry-level programmer  
4. **Overqualification concern** - interviewer saw flight risk
